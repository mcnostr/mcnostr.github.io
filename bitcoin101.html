<p>
	Bitcoin the protocol (“Bitcoin”) is open source software run by participants around the world. 
	Bitcoin the asset (“bitcoin”) can be thought of as units or entries in a public accounting ledger. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Well... why should I care? 
	Lets give it a few minutes of our time and decide if it is worth anymore. <br>
	After all, time is scarce. 
	<br>
	<br>
	A few key features of Bitcoin worth highlighting in a high level examination are:
	<ul>
		<li>Bitcoin the asset is <a href="#bitcoin101scarcity">scarce</a>. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.</li>
		<li>No individual, group, or entity <a href="#bitcoin101nocontrol">controls</a> Bitcoin.</li>
		<li>Bitcoin is <a href="#bitcoin101digital">digital</a>.</li>
		<li>The <a href="#bitcoin101story">story</a> of Bitcoin is facinating.</li> 
	</ul>
</p>
<h4 id="bitcoin101scarcity">Scarcity</h3>
<p>
	Bitcoin is designed to be a scarce digital asset, and its scarcity is one of its defining characteristics.
	This scarcity is primarily achieved through two mechanisms: a limited supply and a predictable issuance schedule. 
	Here's how bitcoin's scarcity works:
	<ul>
		<li>1. Limited supply: Bitcoin's maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins. This means that there will only ever be a finite number of bitcoins in existence. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed or created at the discretion of central banks, bitcoin has a predetermined and limited supply.</li>
		<li>2. Halving events: Bitcoin's issuance is regulated by a process known as 'halving'. Approximately every four years, the number of new bitcoins generated as a reward for miners is reduced by half. This halving event occurs in a programmed and predictable manner and is embedded in the Bitcoin protocol. As a result, the rate at which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation gradually decrease over time until it reaches its maximum supply.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	If you are not already an engineer, try to put yourself into the shoes of one and ask yourself:
	<br>
	<br>
	How can somthing digital be scarce?
	<br>
	<br>
	After all, anything digital boils down to ones and zeros (“bits”). 
	How a specific sequence of bits are interpreted, is what produces the digital thing. 
	The same sequence of bits can exist on any number of computers and if the method of interpretation is known, the digital thing can exist on any number of computers. 
	A third party software company, could easily make a promise that a digital thing under their management will be scarce but there is no guarantee they will always honour their promise. 
	Even if this third party is trustworthy, the same sequence of bits with the same method of interpretation will reproduce the same digital thing on any computer.
	<br>
	<br>
	Scarcity in the digital realm without a trusted third party is a difficult problem to solve. 
	Achieving any sort of consensus in the digital realm without a trusted third party is a difficult problem to solve.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Bitcoin protocol, the system of rules that govern bitcoin, create a system and incentive structure that allows for scarcity and consensus in the digital realm without the need of a trusted third party.
	The scarcity of bitcoin is arguably one of it's most important attributes.
