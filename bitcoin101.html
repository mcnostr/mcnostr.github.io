<h3 id="bitcoin101start">Bitcoin 101</h3>
<p>
	Bitcoin the protocol (“Bitcoin”) is open source software run by participants around the world. 
	Bitcoin the asset (“bitcoin”) can be thought of as units or entries in a public accounting ledger. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Well... why should I care? 
	Lets give it a few minutes of our time and decide if it is worth anymore. <br>
	After all, time is scarce. 
	<br>
	<br>
	A few key features of Bitcoin worth highlighting in a high level examination are:
	<ul>
		<li>Bitcoin the asset is <a href="#bitcoin101scarcity">scarce</a>. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.</li>
		<li>No individual, group, or entity <a href="#bitcoin101nocontrol">controls</a> Bitcoin.</li>
		<li>Bitcoin is <a href="#bitcoin101digital">digital</a>.</li>
		<li>The <a href="#bitcoin101story">story</a> of Bitcoin is facinating.</li> 
	</ul>
</p>
<h4 id="bitcoin101scarcity">Scarcity</h3>
<p>
	Bitcoin is designed to be a scarce digital asset, and its scarcity is one of its defining characteristics.
	This scarcity is primarily achieved through two mechanisms: a limited supply and a predictable issuance schedule. 
	Here's how bitcoin's scarcity works:
	<ul>
		<li>Limited supply: Bitcoin's maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins. This means that there will only ever be a finite number of bitcoins in existence. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed or created at the discretion of central banks, bitcoin has a predetermined and limited supply.</li>
		<li>Halving events: Bitcoin's issuance is regulated by a process known as 'halving'. Approximately every four years, the number of new bitcoins generated as a reward for miners is reduced by half. This halving event occurs in a programmed and predictable manner and is embedded in the Bitcoin protocol. As a result, the rate at which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation gradually decrease over time until it reaches its maximum supply.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	If you are not already an engineer, try to put yourself into the shoes of one and ask yourself:
	<br>
	<br>
	How can somthing digital be scarce?
	<br>
	<br>
	After all, anything digital boils down to ones and zeros (“bits”). 
	How a specific sequence of bits are interpreted, is what produces the digital thing. 
	The same sequence of bits can exist on any number of computers and if the method of interpretation is known, the digital thing can exist on any number of computers. 
	A third party software company, could easily make a promise that a digital thing under their management will be scarce but there is no guarantee they will always honour their promise. 
	Even if this third party is trustworthy, the same sequence of bits with the same method of interpretation will reproduce the same digital thing on any computer.
	<br>
	<br>
	Scarcity in the digital realm without a trusted third party is a difficult problem to solve. 
	Achieving any sort of consensus in the digital realm without a trusted third party is a difficult problem to solve.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Bitcoin protocol, the system of rules that govern bitcoin, create a system and incentive structure that allows for scarcity and consensus in the digital realm without the need of a trusted third party.
	The scarcity of bitcoin is arguably one of it's most important attributes. 
	<br>
	<br>
	It is worth noting that while bitcoin itself is scarce, it is divisible into small units called satoshis.
	One bitcoin is divisible into 100 million satoshis.
</p>
<h4 id="bitcoin101nocontrol">No Trusted Thrid Parties</h3>
<p>
	Already mentioned, bitcoin removes the need for trusted third parties.
	Bitcoin the asset is considered scarce without a promise from a trusted third party. 
	<b>You</b> can easily enforce the 21 million capped supply of bitcoin. 
	Bitcoin the protocol achieves consensus over any updates to the ledger without need of a trusted third party. 
	Again, <b>you</b> can easily ensure that any updates to the ledger are legit. 
	One of the key features of Bitcoin is that it eliminates the need for trusted third parties. 
	Instead, it relies on a distributed network of computers, known as miners and nodes, to maintain the integrity of the system.
	How it achieves this:
	<ul>
		<li>Peer-to-peer network: Bitcoin transactions are conducted directly between users on a peer-to-peer network. When someone initiates a transaction, it is broadcasted to the entire network, and other participants validate and verify the transaction.</li>
		<li>Public Ledger: Every node holds their own copy of the public ledger that records all transactions. The public ledger can be updated by a decentralized network of miners who collectively validate and confirm the transactions. This distributed ledger ensures transparency and immutability.</li>
		<li>Consensus mechanism: Bitcoin employs a consensus mechanism called proof-of-work (“PoW”) to reach agreement on the state of the public ledger. Miners compete to validate and add new blocks of transactions to the public ledger. This decentralized consensus mechanism ensures that no single entity has control over the network, making it difficult for any individual or group to manipulate or censor transactions.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Anyone can download and run the software on their own computer, eliminating the need to trust anyone else.
	Anyone can alter the software how ever they please. 
	Bear in mind, if you make some dramatic changes to the software, your peer-to-peer network may shrink to just you and anyone else that agrees with your changes. 
	There is no company behind Bitcoin. 
	There is no Bitcoin marketing team. 
	There is no individual, group, or entity that controls Bitcoin.
	It is open source software anonymously released and you can do with it what you please, if anything.
</p>
<p>
	With Bitcoin:
	<ul>
		<li>Trusted third parties are not necessary for custody.</li>
		<li>Trusted third parties are not necessary to process and verify transactions.</li>
		<li>Trusted third parties are not necessary to determine nor enforce the issuance of money.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	However, it is important to note that the absence of trusted third parties in Bitcoin also presents challenges. 
	There is no customer help desk to call with questions. 
	There is no transaction disputes or fraud desk.
	Bitcoin is just software released into the wild - there is no one to call.
