			Bitcoin has captured the attention of not just us, but also many others who are delving into the subject. 
			For instance, on May 11, 2022, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) conducted a board meeting focused on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPQiPFqFwOU">Exchange Traded Digital Assets and Commodities</a>. 
			Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Security Exchange Commission (SEC), has discussed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5auv_xrvoJk">bitcoin</a>. 
			Additionally, the founders of prominent tech companies have also explored this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC43pZkpTec">realm extensively</a>. 
			Moreover, politicians and influencers, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia1w0cehWso">Pierre Polivier</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/robert-kennedy-jr-debuts-campaign-at-bitcoin-2023">Kennedy</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1661520223357534209">Desantis</a>, recognize the significance of this topic and consider it worthy of contemplation.

			However, when it comes to new innovations, it is wise to approach them with a healthy dose of skepticism. 
			It cannot be denied that there is a multitude of scams associated with such developments. 
			Instances like the Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, and QuadrigaCX hacks, which resulted in the loss of client coins, serve as just a few examples. 
			Additionally, FTX has emerged as an exchange that seemingly acted unscrupulously and failed to provide a transparent account of client funds. 
			Furthermore, more recently, Coinbase and Binance, two prominent exchanges, have come under scrutiny from the SEC.
		</p>
		<p>
			Notwithstanding the prevalence of scams, it is worth noting that bitcoin has consistently operated as intended since its inception and has never fallen victim to hacking. 
			In fact, bitcoin can be regarded as an accounting innovation, drawing parallels to the historical progression of accounting methods:
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Single Entry Accounting: More than 5,000 years ago, the discovery of Single Entry accounting provided a rudimentary means of organizing financial records. However, this method lacked the ability to authenticate transactions or ensure accountability.</li>
				<li>Double Entry Accounting: Around 600 years ago, the advent of Double Entry accounting revolutionized the system by introducing a comprehensive approach. It involved maintaining two ledgers—one for incoming and the other for outgoing transactions—to enhance accuracy and transparency.</li>
				<li>Triple Entry Accounting: Bitcoin represents a technical innovation, akin to Triple Entry accounting. In this paradigm, all accounting entries are cryptographically signed, and the ledger is decentralized. This decentralization serves as a powerful deterrent against manipulation and fraud.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Similar to many groundbreaking innovations, Bitcoin stands on the shoulders of giants. 
			From the 1970s to the 2000s, various technological breakthroughs emerged, forming the building blocks of Bitcoin and giving rise to the concept of a 'blockchain'. 
			It was on October 31, 2008, that the Bitcoin white paper was published, citing several of these earlier innovations. 
			Subsequently, on January 3, 2009, the genesis block was successfully mined, marking the inception of Bitcoin.

			In this article we will break Bitcoin into several pieces and try to understand how it works.
