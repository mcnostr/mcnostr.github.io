			Bitcoin has captured the attention of not just us, but also many others who are delving into the subject. 
			For instance, on May 11, 2022, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) conducted a board meeting focused on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPQiPFqFwOU">Exchange Traded Digital Assets and Commodities</a>. 
			Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Security Exchange Commission (SEC), has discussed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5auv_xrvoJk">bitcoin</a>. 
			Additionally, the founders of prominent tech companies have also explored this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC43pZkpTec">realm extensively</a>. 
			Moreover, politicians and influencers, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia1w0cehWso">Pierre Polivier</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/robert-kennedy-jr-debuts-campaign-at-bitcoin-2023">Kennedy</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1661520223357534209">Desantis</a>, recognize the significance of this topic and consider it worthy of contemplation.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, when it comes to new innovations, it is wise to approach them with a healthy dose of skepticism. 
			It cannot be denied that there is a multitude of scams associated with such developments. 
			Instances like the Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, and QuadrigaCX hacks, which resulted in the loss of client coins, serve as just a few examples. 
			Additionally, FTX has emerged as an exchange that seemingly acted unscrupulously and failed to provide a transparent account of client funds. 
			Furthermore, more recently, Coinbase and Binance, two prominent exchanges, have come under scrutiny from the SEC.
		</p>
		<p>
			Notwithstanding the prevalence of scams, it is worth noting that bitcoin has consistently operated as intended since its inception and has never fallen victim to hacking. 
			In fact, bitcoin can be regarded as an accounting innovation, drawing parallels to the historical progression of accounting methods:
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Single Entry Accounting: More than 5,000 years ago, the discovery of Single Entry accounting provided a rudimentary means of organizing financial records. However, this method lacked the ability to authenticate transactions or ensure accountability.</li>
				<li>Double Entry Accounting: Around 600 years ago, the advent of Double Entry accounting revolutionized the system by introducing a comprehensive approach. It involved maintaining two ledgers—one for incoming and the other for outgoing transactions—to enhance accuracy and transparency.</li>
				<li>Triple Entry Accounting: Bitcoin represents a technical innovation, akin to Triple Entry accounting. In this paradigm, all accounting entries are cryptographically signed, and the ledger is decentralized. This decentralization serves as a powerful deterrent against manipulation and fraud.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Similar to many groundbreaking innovations, Bitcoin stands on the shoulders of giants. 
			From the 1970s to the 2000s, various technological breakthroughs emerged, forming the building blocks of Bitcoin and giving rise to the concept of a 'blockchain'. 
			It was on October 31, 2008, that the Bitcoin white paper was published, citing several of these earlier innovations. 
			Subsequently, on January 3, 2009, the genesis block was successfully mined, marking the inception of Bitcoin.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this article we will break Bitcoin into several pieces and try to understand how it works.

		<h4 id="bitcoin201digitalnetwork">Digital Network</h3>
		<p>
			The digital network comprises of many computers running the Bitcoin open source code, sending messages back and forth to one another. 
			These computers form a peer-to-peer network, with each computer functioning as an independent actor or participant. 
			Any participant has the freedom to join or exit the network as they choose.
		</p>
		</p>
			Every participant has their own version of the ledger, which contains the complete record of bitcoin transactions, including address balances and movements since its inception. 
			With a personal copy of the ledger, each participant has the capability to conduct real-time audits of the entire network and enforce the rules governing ledger updates. 
			This decentralized approach enables participants to maintain transparency and enforce the ledger's integrity without relying on a centralized authority.
		</p>
		</p>
			Every 10 minutes, on average, a “new page” is added to the ledger. Each “new page” is called a block. 
			And as a participant you can independently audit the “new page” to ensure it has been updated appropriately and if not, you would ignore the “new page”. 
		</p>
		</p>
			The ledger's data structure may not be efficient, but it simplifies the auditing process for participants to review the entire ledger from its inception. 
			Each "new page" or block consists of new transactions that are consolidated into a Merkle tree. 
			A block, conatainning a Merkle tree, is connected to the previous block by hashing the current block with the preceding one. 
			This linkage between blocks ensures that any modification to a prior block would create a ripple effect, affecting all subsequent blocks. 
			Therefore, if Bob attempts to manipulate a previous block to grant himself additional bitcoins, other participants would quickly detect this discrepancy. 
			Similarly, if Bob intends to grant himself more bitcoins in a new block, other participants would promptly identify this inconsistency through their independent examination of the new block. 
			This system establishes a tamper-evident history for the monetary system, ensuring transparency and preventing unauthorized alterations.
		</p>
		</p>
			Why wouldn’t Bob span the network, flooding trillions of new blocks to the peer-to-peer network with bitcoin going to his own address?
		</p>
		</p>
			In order to build a block, a cost is incurred. 
			Mathematically proven, there is no way to build a block without incurring a cost. 
			Participants that incur a cost and build blocks are called miners and they are compensated in new bitcoins.
			For every new block:
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>New bitcoin are created</li>
				<li>New transactions are recorded</li>
				<li>Address balances are updated</li>
			</ul>
			Beginning on January 3, 2009, each new block created 50 new bitcoins. 
			Every 210,000 blocks, the number of new bitcoins created is cut in half and the monetary issuance function, converges on 21 million coins.
			At the time of writing, there have been three halvenings thus far and approximately 19 million of the 21 million coins are in circulation. 
			Currently, 6.25 bitcoin are created every block, which is called the block reward and is the compensation to the miner who incurs a cost.
		</p>
		</p>
			Miners engage in a competitive race to "find" the next block, aiming to secure the block reward as well as transaction fees. 
			To ensure a tangible cost is involved, the mining process is linked to energy consumption. 
			This reliance on energy, governed by the objective laws of physics, becomes an essential requirement for successfully mining a block. 
			The mining process is computationally intensive, requiring a significant amount of electricity, and is referred to as "<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-proof-of-work-concept/">Proof of Work</a>".
		</p>
		<p>
			Miners search for a special number as an output to the SHA256 hash function. 
			This iterative process continues until either the desired output is found or another miner discovers it first. 
			It does not involve traditional calculations; rather, it can be likened to repeatedly rolling exceptionally heavy dice until the desired number is rolled. 
			It is probabilistic and requires electricity. 
			The miner relies on electricity to run, as they perform numerous hash operations per second. 
			The miner combines the current block data, the prior block header hash, and a nounce in the hash function. 
			The miner iterates through many random nounces, until the hash output is the desired outout. 
			If lucky, the miner ultimately succeeds in finding the desired output. 
			When a miner “finds” the desired output, they broadcast the new block to the network and every participant checks to ensure the new block is valid.
		</p>
		<p>
			As an example, lets imagine we have heavy dice that require lots of strength to roll and there is a prize for rollling double 7s.
			Over time, as I roll the heavy dice every day in pursuit of double 7s, I should gradually build strength, allowing me to increase the number of rolls I can make within a day. 
			Moreover, since there is a prize for rolling double 7s, it is highly probable that others will also begin rolling the heavy dice. 
			As the number of rolls increases, so does the likelihood of achieving double 7s. 
			Similarly, as more miners join the network or enhance the efficiency of their computers in converting electricity to hashes, the chances of attaining the desired output become more likely. 
			However, it is crucial that a new block is mined, on average, every ten minutes. 
			Since the issuance of new bitcoin is tied to the creation of new blocks, maintaining this ten-minute interval is vital for upholding the fixed monetary issuance policy of bitcoin.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Bitcoin protocol incorporates a difficulty adjustment mechanism, which takes place every 2016 blocks (interestingly, this number is the inverse of 6102 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102">Executive Order 6102</a>). 
			This adjustment dynamically modifies the target hash output to either increase or decrease the likelihood of finding it. 
			Think of it as gears that adjust to maintain the pace of generating new blocks, aiming for an average interval of 10 minutes. 
			For instance, a hash function output containing ten leading zeros is less probable to be found compared to an output with only five leading zeros. 
			The difficulty adjustment mechanism allows for the fine-tuning of the target output, ensuring a balanced and consistent mining process while accounting for variations in computational power across the network.
			This is how the difficulty adjustment keeps the timechain (blockchain) ticking every 10 minutes, on average.
		</p>
		<p>
			Exahash (“EH”) is the metric used to assess the aggregate computational power behind the Bitcoin network. 
			EH is the number of cyptographic hashes per second (1 exahash = 1 quintillion hashes).
		</p>
		<p>
			Returning to our question - Why wouldn’t Bob span the network, flooding trillions of new blocks to the peer-to-peer network with bitcoin going to his own address?
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, Bob would face a substantial and very real cost in attempting to carry out such an action, and there are no means to bypass this cost due to the laws of physics. 
			As the overall computational power, often measured in EH (Exahashes), increases on the network, the task becomes increasingly more challenging and costly for Bob. 
			Furthermore, the compensation Bob receives for mining these blocks is an asset endogenous to the network so, disrupting the network would render Bob's compensation worthless.
		</p>
		<p>
			The combination of peer-to-peer nodes conducting real-time audits and miners investing resources to construct new blocks, enabling ledger updates and the issuance of new coins, forms an interesting incentive structure that has proven effective since its inception. 
			Although Bitcoin relies on inefficient data structures and requires energy, money serves as the foundational layer of our society. 
			Money serves as the medium through which transactions occur, and is agruably the most honest means by which humans communicate their preferences. 
			The ability to control the monetary system holds tremendous power, and <a href="http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A9493">history</a> has demonstrated that this power is susceptible to abuse. 
			Such control over money distorts the expression of our preferences and can have profound societal implications. 
			Bitcoin, while not flawless, offers a solution by eliminating centralized control over the monetary system, thereby safeguarding against manipulation and ensuring a more equitable framework for expressing and preserving societal preferences.

		<h4 id="bitcoin201digitalasset">Digital Asset</h3>
		<p>
			Bitcoin the asset does not exist in physical form, such as coins in your pocket or gold bars in a vault. 
			Instead, it is digital data, represented by bits (ones and zeros) stored on computers. 
			To simplify, envision a spreadsheet where each row represents an address and its corresponding balance. 
			Each address is assigned a specific balance within this ledger. 
			Remember that each participant or node possesses their own individual copy of this spreadsheet or ledger.
		</p>
		<p>
			You don't actual own coins. 
			Rather, ownership is tied to knowledge of a private key — an exceptionally large number generated randomly. 
			By utilizing a private key associated with a particular address, one can generate a digital signature that facilitates the transfer of "coins" (which exist purely as digital data) from one address to another. 
			The intriguing aspect here is that you do not possess anything physical; instead, you possess knowledge of a secret number. 
			This raises an interesting question: can you truly own a number, or can you only know a number? 
			Bitcoin blurs the distinction between ownership and knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			As an example, let's imagine a spreadsheet with rows representing addresses and their corresponding balances. 
			In this scenario, you possess a private key associated with the address labeled "ABC," which holds a balance of 0.1 bitcoin. 
			By utilizing this private key (a secret and large number known only to you) you can generate a digital signature for the address ABC. 
			The network verifies the validity of a transaction by checking for a valid digital signature, among other criteria, and records it in the ledger. 
			Suppose we wish to transfer the entire balance from address ABC to address XYZ. 
			In that case, we would create a packet of data comprising the following information: 
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>an input amount (0.1 bitcoin)</li>
				<li>an output amount (0.09 bitcoin)</li>
				<li>the recipient address (address XYZ)</li>
				<li>the miner fee (0.01 bitcoin)</li>
				<li>a valid digital signature</li>
			</ul>
			The process can be likened to writing a check, where crucial information such as the amount, recipient, sender, and a valid signature are included. 
			Next, we would "mail" this check by broadcasting the packet of data to the peer-to-peer network. 
			In a similar manner, just as a bank teller confirms the availability of funds and the authenticity of the signature, each node or participant in the network verifies the validity of the packet of data and its digital signature. 
			Once the transaction is deemed valid, miners retrieve the transaction from the mempool and incorporate it into a "new page of the ledger" or a new block. 
			At this stage, the miner claims the transaction fee and the block reward for themselves. 
			The miner broadcasts the newly created block to the peer-to-peer network, leading to the updating of the ledger for all participating nodes. 
			The valid transaction becomes part of the ledger and is now recorded in the 'blockchain'.
		</p>
		<p>
			Simply put, by using a very large number (the private key) and the peer-to-peer network, you have updated the ledger. 
			The balance of ABC is now 0 bitcoin. 
			The balance of XYZ is 0.09 bitcoin. 
			The miner has earned 0.01 bitcoin in transaction fees and the block reward. 
			The ledger is like a public chalk board and you have permission to make edits to the chalk board if you can prove you are the private key holder.
		</p>
		<p>
			We tend to think of coins as physical alloy inside a physical wallet. 
			But there are no physical coins sitting in a physical wallet. 
			There is a ledger that you can edit, if you have a private key. 
			How you store your private key could be considered your wallet. 
			Hot wallet is the term used when private keys are stored on an internet connected device. 
			Cold wallet is the term used when private keys are stored using a method that does not connect to the internet. 
			Since a private key is just information, with creativity you can store your private key in many different and unique ways. 
			I am not conviced we fully understand the implications of a money that is purely information.

		<h4 id="bitcoin201technicalsummary">Technical Summary</h3>
		<p>
			To provide a technical summary, let's outline some of the key elements mentioned previously:
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Peer-to-peer network architecture: Communication among computers is decentralized, and there is no central entity controlling ledger updates. Instead, computers interact directly, maintain their own ledgers, and independently enforce the rules to updating the ledger.</li>
				<li>Proof-of-work: The consensus mechanism relies on proof of work (PoW). All network computers reach a consensus on the ledger's state by recognizing the longest chain, which represents the most 'work' or computational effort.</li>
				<li>Difficulty adjustment: This mechanism ensures a fixed rate of bitcoin issuance. Regardless of the number of competing miners, blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes on average.</li>
				<li>Block subsidy halving: Mining rewards decrease by half annually. Miners, who incur a real world cost in return for bitcoin (an asset engoenous to the network), are incentivized to avoid mining fraudulent blocks. The halving occurs every 210,000 blocks and leads to a total convergence of 21 million coins in existence.</li>
				<li>Hash functions & Merkle trees: These data structures make up the building blocks of the blockchain.</li>
				<li>Private and public key cryptography: Digital signatures with private keys are utilized to transfer balances within the ledger.</li>
			</ul>
