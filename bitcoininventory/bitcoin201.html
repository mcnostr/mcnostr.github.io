			Bitcoin has captured the attention of not just us, but also many others who are delving into the subject. 
			For instance, on May 11, 2022, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) conducted a board meeting focused on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPQiPFqFwOU">Exchange Traded Digital Assets and Commodities</a>. 
			Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Security Exchange Commission (SEC), has discussed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5auv_xrvoJk">bitcoin</a>. 
			Additionally, the founders of prominent tech companies have also explored this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC43pZkpTec">realm extensively</a>. 
			Moreover, politicians and influencers, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia1w0cehWso">Pierre Polivier</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/robert-kennedy-jr-debuts-campaign-at-bitcoin-2023">Kennedy</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1661520223357534209">Desantis</a>, recognize the significance of this topic and consider it worthy of contemplation.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, when it comes to new innovations, it is wise to approach them with a healthy dose of skepticism. 
			It cannot be denied that there is a multitude of scams associated with such developments. 
			Instances like the Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, and QuadrigaCX hacks, which resulted in the loss of client coins, serve as just a few examples. 
			Additionally, FTX has emerged as an exchange that seemingly acted unscrupulously and failed to provide a transparent account of client funds. 
			Furthermore, more recently, Coinbase and Binance, two prominent exchanges, have come under scrutiny from the SEC.
		</p>
		<p>
			Notwithstanding the prevalence of scams, it is worth noting that bitcoin has consistently operated as intended since its inception and has never fallen victim to hacking. 
			In fact, bitcoin can be regarded as an accounting innovation, drawing parallels to the historical progression of accounting methods:
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Single Entry Accounting: More than 5,000 years ago, the discovery of Single Entry accounting provided a rudimentary means of organizing financial records. However, this method lacked the ability to authenticate transactions or ensure accountability.</li>
				<li>Double Entry Accounting: Around 600 years ago, the advent of Double Entry accounting revolutionized the system by introducing a comprehensive approach. It involved maintaining two ledgers—one for incoming and the other for outgoing transactions—to enhance accuracy and transparency.</li>
				<li>Triple Entry Accounting: Bitcoin represents a technical innovation, akin to Triple Entry accounting. In this paradigm, all accounting entries are cryptographically signed, and the ledger is decentralized. This decentralization serves as a powerful deterrent against manipulation and fraud.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Similar to many groundbreaking innovations, Bitcoin stands on the shoulders of giants. 
			From the 1970s to the 2000s, various technological breakthroughs emerged, forming the building blocks of Bitcoin and giving rise to the concept of a 'blockchain'. 
			It was on October 31, 2008, that the Bitcoin white paper was published, citing several of these earlier innovations. 
			Subsequently, on January 3, 2009, the genesis block was successfully mined, marking the inception of Bitcoin.

			In this article we will break Bitcoin into several pieces and try to understand how it works.

		<h4 id="bitcoin201digitalnetwork">Digital Network</h3>
		<p>
			The digital network comprises of many computers running the Bitcoin open source code, sending messages back and forth to one another. 
			These computers form a peer-to-peer network, with each computer functioning as an independent actor or participant. 
			Any participant has the freedom to join or exit the network as they choose.
		</p>
		</p>
			Every participant has their own version of the ledger, which contains the complete record of bitcoin transactions, including address balances and movements since its inception. 
			With a personal copy of the ledger, each participant has the capability to conduct real-time audits of the entire network and enforce the rules governing ledger updates. 
			This decentralized approach enables participants to maintain transparency and enforce the ledger's integrity without relying on a centralized authority.
		</p>
		</p>
			Every 10 minutes, on average, a “new page” is added to the ledger. Each “new page” is called a block. 
			And as a participant you can independently audit the “new page” to ensure it has been updated appropriately and if not, you would ignore the “new page”. 
		</p>
		</p>
			The ledger's data structure may not be efficient, but it simplifies the auditing process for participants to review the entire ledger from its inception. 
			Each "new page" or block consists of new transactions that are consolidated into a Merkle tree. 
			A block, conatainning a Merkle tree, is connected to the previous block by hashing the current block with the preceding one. 
			This linkage between blocks ensures that any modification to a prior block would create a ripple effect, affecting all subsequent blocks. 
			Therefore, if Bob attempts to manipulate a previous block to grant himself additional bitcoins, other participants would quickly detect this discrepancy. 
			Similarly, if Bob intends to grant himself more bitcoins in a new block, other participants would promptly identify this inconsistency through their independent examination of the new block. 
			This system establishes a tamper-evident history for the monetary system, ensuring transparency and preventing unauthorized alterations.
		</p>
		</p>
			Why wouldn’t Bob span the network, flooding trillions of new blocks to the peer-to-peer network with bitcoin going to his own address?
		</p>
		</p>
			In order to build a block, a cost is incurred. 
			Mathematically proven, there is no way to build a block without incurring a cost. 
			Participants that incur a cost and build blocks are called miners and they are compensated in new bitcoins.
			For every new block:
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>New bitcoin are created</li>
				<li>New transactions are recorded</li>
				<li>Address balances are updated</li>
			</ul>
			Beginning on January 3, 2009, each new block created 50 new bitcoins. 
			Every 210,000 blocks, the number of new bitcoins created is cut in half and the monetary issuance function, converges on 21 million coins.
			At the time of writing, there have been three halvenings thus far and approximately 19 million of the 21 million coins are in circulation. 
			Currently, 6.25 bitcoin are created every block, which is called the block reward and is the compensation to the miner who incurs a cost.
		</p>
		</p>
			Miners engage in a competitive race to "find" the next block, aiming to secure the block reward as well as transaction fees. 
			To ensure a tangible cost is involved, the mining process is linked to energy consumption. 
			This reliance on energy, governed by the objective laws of physics, becomes an essential requirement for successfully mining a block. 
			The mining process is computationally intensive, requiring a significant amount of electricity, and is referred to as "<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-proof-of-work-concept/">Proof of Work</a>".
