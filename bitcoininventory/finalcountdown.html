            Got yourself a "lake front safety deposit box"? 
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are unfamiliar with the term, a "lake front safety deposit box" is what Canucks call their investment properties since real estate has replaced people's savings accounts. 
			People prefer owning and managing properties as opposed to savings. 
			The chart below from the <a href="https://creastats.crea.ca/en-CA/">Canadian Real Estate Association</a> shows a ~215% increase or ~6.2% CAGR in Canadian real estate values from 2005 to 2023.   
            <br>
            <a href="https://creastats.crea.ca/en-CA/"><img src="/images/bitcoininventoryimages/finalcountdown/historicalhouseprices.png" alt="Historical House Prices" class="center"></a>
		</p>
		<p>	
			But have you ever stopped to ask yourself why real estate values have ballooned in the last 15 years?
			In that same timeframe, the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901&cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=01&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2005&cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=01&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2023&referencePeriods=20050101%2C20230101">Canadian population</a> has risen from around 32 million to 40 million, indicating a growth of approximately 23% or a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 1.17%. 
			While there may have been some demographic changes within the population, the increase in demand for real estate has far outpaced population growth. 
			This surge in demand can be attributed to a trend where both Canadians and foreigners are acquiring multiple properties as investments. 
			Whether consciously or subconsciously, people recognize that real estate is a superior asset compared to cash in the bank.
		</p>
		<p>
			Is it possible that the rise in real estate demand, leading to an increase in real estate value, is attributable to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/R6A7ffnz5Cc">decrease</a> in the value of the dollar?
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout this particular time period (as well as preceding it), the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/indicators/key-variables/monetary-aggregates/">monetary aggregates</a>a> in Canada, specifically M1 and M2, have been consistently growing at a rate of approximately 10% every 12 months. 
			From a logical standpoint, an asset with a growth rate lower than that of the money supply should appreciate in value because there would be a greater number of dollars competing for a limited supply of goods.
			<br>
			<br>
			<a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/indicators/key-variables/monetary-aggregates/"><img src="/images/bitcoininventoryimages/finalcountdown/CanadaMonetaryAggregates.PNG" alt="Canada Monetary Aggregates" class="center"></a>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is exponential growth in Canadian monetary aggregates and is similar for the United States. 
			<br>

			<br>
			<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM201USA189N"><img src="/images/bitcoininventoryimages/finalcountdown/USM2.PNG" alt="US M2" class="center"></a>
		</p>
		<p>
			US housing prices have ballooned as well.

		</p>
		<p>
			Arguably, due to the presence of inflationary money, an asset with a growth rate lower than that of the money supply tends to accumulate a monetary premium. 
			Real estate is a material asset with ongoing maintenance costs, property tax, and it's utility value should depreciate from wear and tear, yet the value increases over time. 
			The value of real estate appears to have significantly exceeded its utility value and carries a substantial monetary premium. 
			When money fails to hold its value, individuals seek out alternative assets that are more likely to retain their value, resulting in the accumulation of a monetary premium. 
			Is it possible that other assets are also carrying a monetary premium?
		</p>
		<p>
			Connected to this same idea, take a look at the S&P 500 and US M2 side by side. 
			Check out this <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4455999-money-supply-a-good-predictor-for-s-and-p-500-index">article</a> which thoroughly establishes a the connection between the S&P 500 index and M2 money supply.

			For the majority of individuals, constructing a diversified portfolio consisting of real estate, equities, and other assets is simply an attempt to protect the purchasing power of their hard-earned money. 
			For the average person, building a portfolio of investments is simply trying to build a perfect money.  
			If there were a perfect money, there would be far less need to build a portfolio of diversified investments. 
			<a href="https://twitter.com/luke_broyles">Luke Broyles</a>, a real estate professional, explains this concept very well. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We give up our time and energy five days a week in return for dollars, which we know will be worth less tomorrow. 
			This creates an incentive to spend. 
			With the portion of our money that we manage to save through discipline, we are compelled to seek out alternative assets capable of preserving their purchasing power. 
			Otherwise, as savers, we may face negative consequences. 
			The substantial rise in real estate and equities could potentially be a consequence of this phenomenon. 
			It seems as though we have one job to earn our money, and a second job to keep our money. 
			In a similar vein, employed by day, gamblers by night.  
			Furthermore, the factors influencing our choices regarding spending, saving, and investing (or gambling) are continually shifting due to the decisions made by those in positions of authority within central banks. 
			Make one wrong move, and your expended time and energy is erased.
		</p>
		<p>
			In essence, we find ourselves playing a game where the rules are constently changing by a select few individuals in positions of power. 
			If it were a game of Monopoly, would we still be sitting at the table? 
		</p>
		<p>
			We are in the final countdown for this game. 
			Every passing day, an increasing number of individuals discover an alternative that grants them the ability to step away from the table. 
			Allowing them to have absolute certainty in the present and future supply of the money they exchange their time and energy for. 
			Allowing them to fully focus on their job, passions, and interests, leaving behind the anxious gambling that was needed to survive. 
			Allowing them to have confidence in their future. 
			This alternative allows them to "go Galt" and could potentially stop the motor of the world.
