            Got yourself a "lake front safety deposit box"? 
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are unfamiliar with the term, a "lake front safety deposit box" is what Canucks call their investment properties since real estate has replaced people's savings accounts. 
			People prefer owning and managing properties as opposed to savings. 
			The chart below from the <a href="https://creastats.crea.ca/en-CA/">Canadian Real Estate Association</a> shows a ~215% increase or ~6.2% CAGR in Canadian real estate values from 2005 to 2023.   
            <br>
            <a href="https://creastats.crea.ca/en-CA/"><img src="/images/bitcoininventoryimages/finalcountdown/historicalhouseprices.png" alt="Historical House Prices" class="center"></a>
		</p>
		<p>	
			But have you ever stopped to ask yourself why real estate values have ballooned in the last 15 years?
			During this same time period, the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901&cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=01&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2005&cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=01&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2023&referencePeriods=20050101%2C20230101">Canadian population</a> has increased from roughly 32 million to 40 million, which is a ~23% or a ~1.17% CAGR. 
			While there would be some demographic changes among the population, the growth in demand for real estate has greatly surpassed population growth. 
			The increase in demand could be attributed to a trend of Canadian’s and foreigners owning more than one property as investments. 
			Consciously or subconsciously, people understand that cash in the bank is an inferior asset compared to real estate. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Is it possible that the rise in real estate demand, leading to an increase in real estate value, is attributable to a decrease in the value of the dollar?
		</p>
		<p>
			During this same time period (and also prior) Canada's <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/indicators/key-variables/monetary-aggregates/">monetary aggregates</a> (M1 & M2) have been increasing around 10% every 12 months. 
			Rationally, something with a lower growth rate than the money supply should increase in value since there would be more dollars making claims to fewer goods. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/indicators/key-variables/monetary-aggregates/"><img src="/images/bitcoininventoryimages/finalcountdown/CanadaMonetaryAggregates.PNG" alt="Canada Monetary Aggregates" class="center"></a>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is exponential growth in Canadian monetary aggregates and is similar for the United States. 
			<br>
			<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM203CAA189N"><img src="/images/bitcoininventoryimages/finalcountdown/CanadaM2+.PNG" alt="Canada M2+" class="center"></a>
			<br>
			<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM201USA189N"><img src="/images/bitcoininventoryimages/finalcountdown/USM2.PNG" alt="US M2" class="center"></a>
		</p>
		<p>
			US housing prices have ballooned as well.
			<br>
			<a href="https://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-adjusted-prices/inflation-adjusted-housing-prices/"><img src="/images/bitcoininventoryimages/finalcountdown/USHousingIndex.PNG" alt="US Housing Index" class="center"></a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Arguably, as a result of inflationary money, something with a lower growth rate compared to the money supply accumulates a monetary premium. 
			Real estate is a material asset with ongoing maintenance costs, property tax, and it's utility value should depreciate from wear and tear. 
			The value of real estate seems to have greatly surpassed its utility value and is carrying a heafty monetary premium. 
			When the money does not hold its value, people look elsewhere for assets that are more likely to hold its value and as result, and a monetary premium starts to accumulate. 
			Could other assets also be carrying a monetary premium? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Connected to this same idea, take a look at the S&P 500 and US M2 side by side. 
			Check out this <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4455999-money-supply-a-good-predictor-for-s-and-p-500-index">article</a> which thoroughly establishes a the connection between the S&P 500 index and M2 money supply.

			Building a portfolio of real estate, equities, and various other assets is often times simply an attempt to safeguard the purchasing power of the money one has earned.
			For the average person, building a portfolio of investments is simply trying to build a perfect money. 
			<a href="https://twitter.com/luke_broyles">Luke Broyles</a>, a real estate professional, explains this concept very well. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We give up our time and energy five days a week in return for dollars, which we know will be worth less tomorrow. 
			This creates an incentive to spend. 
			For the dollars that we are disciplined enough to save, we are forced to search for alternative assets that can maintain their purchasing power, otherwise be punished as a saver. 
			The massive rise in real estate and equities, could be a result of this. 
			It seems as though we are employed by day, gamblers by night. 
			Or similarily, we have one job to earn our money, and a second job to keep our money. 
			And the parameters that impact our decisions to spend, save, and invest (gamble) are constently changing by those in charge of the central banks. 
			Make one wrong move, and your expended time and energy is erased.
		</p>
		<p>
			In essence, we find ourselves playing a game where the rules are constently changing by a select few individuals in positions of power. 
			If it were a game of Monopoly, would we still be sitting at the table? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Every passing day, an increasing number of individuals discover an alternative that grants them the ability to step away from the table. 
			Allowing them to have absolute certainty in the present and future supply of the money they exchange their time and energy for. 
			Allowing them to fully focus on their job, passions, and interests, leaving behind the anxious gambling that was needed to survive. 
			Allowing them to have confidence in their future. 
			This alternative allows them to "go Galt" and could potentially stop the motor of the world.
