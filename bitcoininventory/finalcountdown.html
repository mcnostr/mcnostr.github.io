            Got yourself a "lake front safety deposit box"? 
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are unfamiliar with the term, a "lake front safety deposit box" is what Canucks call their investment properties since real estate has replaced people's savings accounts. 
			Due to price appreciation of real estate, people prefer owning and managing properties as opposed to savings. 
			The chart below from the <a href="https://creastats.crea.ca/en-CA/">Canadian Real Estate Association</a> shows a ~215% increase or ~6.2% CAGR in Canadian real estate values from 2005 to 2023.   
            <br>
            <a href="https://creastats.crea.ca/en-CA/"><img src="/images/bitcoininventoryimages/finalcountdown/historicalhouseprices.png" alt="Historical House Prices" class="center"></a>
		</p>
		<p>	
			But have you ever stopped to ask yourself why real estate values have ballooned in the last 15 years?
			During this same time period, the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901&cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=01&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2005&cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=01&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2023&referencePeriods=20050101%2C20230101">Canadian population</a> has increased from roughly 32 million to 40 million, which is a ~23% or a ~1.17% CAGR. 
			While there would be some demographic changes among the population, the growth in demand for real estate has greatly surpassed population growth. 
			The increase in demand could also be attributed to a trend of Canadian’s owning more than one property and foreign investors. 
			Consciously or subconsciously, people understand that cash in the bank is an inferior asset compared to real estate. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Is it possible that the rise in real estate demand, leading to an increase in real estate value, is attributable to a decrease in the value of the dollar?
		</p>
		<p>
			During this same time period (and also prior) Canada's <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/indicators/key-variables/monetary-aggregates/">monetary aggregates</a> (M1 & M2) have been increasing around 10% every 12 months. 
			Rationally, something with a lower growth rate than the money supply should increase in value. 
			Where this is the case, there are more dollars making claims to fewer goods.

		</p>
		<p>
			This is exponential growth in Canadian monetary aggregates and is similar for the United States.

		</p>

			Connected to this same idea, take a look at the S&P 500 and US M2 side by side. 
			Check out this <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4455999-money-supply-a-good-predictor-for-s-and-p-500-index">article</a> which more thoroughly establishes a the connection between the S&P 500 index and M2 money supply.

			We give up our time and energy five days a week in return for dollars, which we know will be worth less tomorrow. 
			This creates an incentive to spend. 
			For the dollars that we are disciplined enough to save, we are forced to search for alternative assets that can maintain their purchasing power, otherwise be punished as a saver. 
			The massive rise in real estate and equities, could be a result of this. 
			It seems as though we are employed by day, gamblers by night. 
			And the parameters that impact your decisions to spend, save, and invest (gamble) are constently changing. 
			Make one wrong move, and your expended time and energy is erased.
		</p>
		<p>
			In essence, we find ourselves playing a game where the rules are constently changing by a select few individuals in positions of power. 
			If it were a game of Monopoly, would we still be sitting at the table?
