            Got yourself a "lake front safety deposit box"? 
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are unfamiliar with the term, a "lake front safety deposit box" is what Canucks call their investment properties since real estate has replaced people's savings accounts. 
			Due to price appreciation of real estate, people prefer owning and managing properties as opposed to savings. 
			The chart below from the <a href="https://creastats.crea.ca/en-CA/">Canadian Real Estate Association</a> shows a ~215% increase or ~6.2% CAGR in Canadian real estate values from 2005 to 2023.   
            <br>
            <a href="https://creastats.crea.ca/en-CA/"><img src="/images/bitcoininventoryimages/finalcountdown/historicalhouseprices.png" alt="Historical House Prices" class="centre"></a>
		</p>
		<p>	
			But have you ever stopped to ask yourself why real estate values have ballooned in the last 15 years?
			During this same time period, the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901&cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=01&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2005&cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=01&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2023&referencePeriods=20050101%2C20230101">Canadian population</a> has increased from roughly 32 million to 40 million, which is a ~23% or a ~1.17% CAGR. 
			While there would be some demographic changes among the population, the growth in demand for real estate has greatly surpassed population growth. 
			The increase in demand could also be attributed to a trend of Canadian’s owning more than one property and foreign investors. 
			Consciously or subconsciously, people understand that cash in the bank is an inferior asset compared to real estate. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Is it possible that the rise in real estate demand, leading to an increase in real estate value, is attributable to a decreasae in the value of the dollar?
		</p>
		<p>
			During this same time period (and even prior) Canada's <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/indicators/key-variables/monetary-aggregates/">monetary aggregates</a> (M1 & M2) have been increasing around 10% every 12 months. 
			It is rational to say, anything with a lower growth rate would increase in value.

		</p>
		<p>
			This is exponential growth in Canadian monetary aggregates and is similar for the United States.
