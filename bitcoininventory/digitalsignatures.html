		<h3 id="digitalsignaturesstart">Digital Signatures</h3>
		<p>
      Digital signatures are used in Bitcoin, Nostr, and many other applications. 
      Remember, Bitcoin is a like a public wall containing a list of who owns what. 
      In order to change the public wall, you have to produce an appropriate digital signature. 
      Traditionally, Bitcoin uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (“ECDSA”) over the secp256k1 curve with SHA256 hashes for authenticating transactions. 
      Later in this article we see there is a BIP to introduce the Schnorr Signature scheme. 
      But first, lets get a high level understanding of digital signatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      With physical signatures, you apend a sequence of characteristics (typically your full name) in your own unique font to a physical document. 
      A digital signature does this similarly but using mathematics. 
      Common digital signature schemes are:
      <ul>
        <li>RSA – Rivest-Shamis-Adleman scheme</li>
        <li>DSS – Digital Signature Standard</li>
        <li>ECDSA -  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm</li>
        <li>Schnorr Signatures</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is actually harder to forge a digital signature than a physical signature. 
      To sign something digitally, you have to first produce two keys:
      <ol>
        <li>Private Key – Signing Key (Sk)</li>
        <li>Public Key – Verifying Key (Vk)</li>
      </ol>
      Your private key is kept secret and your public key is known to others. 
      It is infeasible to generate the private key by knowing the public key. 
      You can generate the public key by knowing the private key. 
      This is known as a one way function.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have an electronic document or message (M) that you would like to sign, you need both M and your private key (Sk). 
      With M and Sk, you create a signature (Sm) that is unique. 
      A mathematical transformation is performed by taking M and Sk as inputs, which produces a unique output (the signature). 
      This signature is a sequence of numbers. 
      Lets refer to the signature as Sm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to verify the signature, a person would take M, Sm, and the signer’s public key (Vk). 
      Again, using a mathematical transformation, you can verify that the message (M), and signature (Sm), correspond to the private key (Sk) that is associated with the public key (Vk). 
      You do not need to know the signer’s private key to perform this verification, you only need their public key. 
    </p>
    <p>
      With digital signatures, you can bind an identity to a digital message (assuming ONLY that identity has the private key). 
      Keep in mind, the message is an input to the mathematical transformation that produces the signature. 
      The signature changes based on the message, whereas a physical signature is the same regardless of the document being signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      More accurately, the message being signed is typically the cryptographic hash of the full message. 
      We can refer to the full message as FM and the cryptographic hash of the full message as M. 
      In most signature algorithms you are signing M, not FM. 
      The hash of any FM will produce an output of the same length every time. 
      By using M as the input to signature algorithm, we keep a consistent input length to the signature algorithm. 
      In this application, it is important that the cryptographic hash function is collision resistant. 
      Collision resistant means that two different inputs (FM) could not produce the same output hash. 
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some applications of digital signatures:  
      <ul>
        <li>PGP uses RSA but also supports DSA and ECDSA.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a href=”https://www.orchid.systems/articles/2022/pgp-its-pretty-good-story”>story</a> of Zimmerman and PGP is legendary.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bitcoin uses ECDSA although <a href=”https://bips.xyz/340”>BIP 340</a> introduces Schnorr Signatures.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Among other benefits, Schnorr Signatrues reduce the complexity of Bitcoin transactions, leading to lower transaction fees.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Nostr uses Schnorr Signatures for secp256k1.</li>
        <li>ECDSA is popular and also used in SSL/TLS certificates, secure email, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested, try playing around with digital signatures. 
      Use PGP in a command terminal and sign a document, or set up an account on nostr and send an event, or try sending a bitcoin transaction - All of these would involve a digital signature. 
      With the growth in artificial intelligence, digital signatures will likely become the method of proving ones online identity and online activity. 
      I suspect digital signatures will be <i>key</i> in our digital future.
