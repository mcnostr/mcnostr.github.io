<h3 id="bitcoin101start">Bitcoin 101</h3>
<p>
	Bitcoin the protocol (“Bitcoin”) is open source software run by participants around the world. 
	Bitcoin the asset (“bitcoin”) can be thought of as units or entries in a public accounting ledger. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Well... why should I care? 
	Lets give it a few minutes of our time and decide if it is worth anymore. <br>
	After all, time is scarce. 
	<br>
	<br>
	A few key features of Bitcoin worth highlighting are:
	<ul>
		<li>Bitcoin the asset is <a href="#bitcoin101scarcity">scarce</a>. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.</li>
		<li>No individual, group, or entity <a href="#bitcoin101nocontrol">controls</a> Bitcoin.</li>
		<li>Bitcoin is <a href="#bitcoin101digital">digital</a>.</li>
		<li>The <a href="#bitcoin101story">story</a> of Bitcoin is facinating.</li> 
	</ul>
</p>
<h4 id="bitcoin101scarcity">Scarcity</h3>
<p>
	Bitcoin is designed to be a scarce digital asset, and scarcity is one of its defining characteristics.
	This scarcity is primarily achieved through two mechanisms: a limited supply and a predictable issuance schedule. 
	Here's how bitcoin's scarcity works:
	<ul>
		<li>Limited supply: Bitcoin's maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins. This means that there will only ever be a finite number of bitcoins in existence. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed or created at the discretion of central banks, bitcoin has a predetermined and limited supply.</li>
		<li>Halving events: Bitcoin's issuance is regulated by a process known as 'halving'. Approximately every four years, the number of new bitcoins generated as a reward for miners is reduced by half. This halving event occurs in a programmed and predictable manner and is embedded in the Bitcoin protocol. As a result, the rate at which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation gradually decrease over time until it reaches its maximum supply.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	If you are not already an engineer, try to put yourself into the shoes of one and ask yourself:
	<br>
	<br>
	How can somthing digital be scarce?
	<br>
	<br>
	After all, anything digital boils down to ones and zeros (“bits”). 
	How a specific sequence of bits are interpreted, is what produces the digital thing. 
	The same sequence of bits can exist on any number of computers and if the method of interpretation is known, the digital thing can exist on any number of computers. 
	A third party software company, could easily make a promise that a digital thing under their management will be scarce but there is no guarantee they will always honour their promise. 
	Even if this third party is trustworthy, the same sequence of bits with the same method of interpretation will reproduce the same digital thing on any computer.
	<br>
	<br>
	Scarcity in the digital realm without a trusted third party is a difficult problem to solve. 
	Achieving any sort of consensus in the digital realm without a trusted third party is a difficult problem to solve.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Bitcoin protocol, the system of rules that govern bitcoin, create a system and incentive structure that allows for scarcity and consensus in the digital realm without a trusted third party.
	The scarcity of bitcoin is arguably one of it's most important attributes. 
	<br>
	<br>
	It is worth noting that while bitcoin itself is scarce, it is divisible into small units called satoshis.
	One bitcoin is divisible into 100 million satoshis.
</p>
<h4 id="bitcoin101nocontrol">No Trusted Third Parties</h3>
<p>
	Already mentioned, bitcoin removes the need for trusted third parties.
	Bitcoin the asset is considered scarce without a promise. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>You</b> can easily enforce the 21 million capped supply of bitcoin. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Bitcoin the protocol achieves consensus over any updates to the ledger without the need of a trusted third party. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Again, <b>you</b> can easily ensure that any updates to the ledger are legit. 
	<br>
	<br>
	One of the key features of Bitcoin is that it eliminates the need for trusted third parties. 
	Instead, it relies on a distributed network of computers, known as miners and nodes, to maintain the integrity of the system.
	How it achieves this:
	<ul>
		<li>Peer-to-peer network: Bitcoin transactions are conducted directly between users on a peer-to-peer network. When someone initiates a transaction, it is broadcasted to the entire network, and other participants validate and verify the transaction.</li>
		<li>Public Ledger: Every node holds their own copy of the public ledger that records all transactions. The public ledger can be updated by a decentralized network of miners who collectively validate and confirm the transactions. This distributed ledger ensures transparency and immutability.</li>
		<li>Consensus mechanism: Bitcoin employs a consensus mechanism called proof-of-work (“PoW”) to reach agreement on the state of the public ledger. Miners compete to validate and add new blocks of transactions to the public ledger. This decentralized consensus mechanism ensures that no single entity has control over the network, making it difficult for any individual or group to manipulate or censor transactions.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Anyone can review, download, and run the software on their own computer, eliminating the need to trust anyone else.
	Anyone can alter the software how ever they please. 
	Bear in mind, if you make some dramatic changes to the software, your peer-to-peer network may shrink to just you and anyone else that agrees with your changes. 
	There is no company behind Bitcoin. 
	There is no Bitcoin marketing team. 
	There is no individual, group, or entity that controls Bitcoin.
	It is open source software anonymously released and you can do with it what you please, if anything.
</p>
<p>
	With Bitcoin:
	<ul>
		<li>Trusted third parties are not necessary for custody.</li>
		<li>Trusted third parties are not necessary to process and verify transactions.</li>
		<li>Trusted third parties are not necessary to determine nor enforce the issuance of money.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	However, it is important to note that the absence of trusted third parties in Bitcoin also presents challenges. 
	There is no customer help desk to call with questions. 
	There is no transaction disputes or fraud desk.
	Bitcoin is just software released into the wild - there is no one to call.
</P>
<h4 id="bitcoin101digital">Digital</h3>
<p>
	Bitcoin is digital which allows it to carry several attributes worth mentioning:
	<ul>
		<li>Durable: Since Bitcoin exists in the digital realm, it is just information. This makes bitcoin nonperishable.</li>
		<li>Portable: Bitcoin has no physical mass. It can be transported and stored unlike any other physical asset.</li>
		<li>Verifiable: It is easy for any individual to verify the authenticity of a bitcoin.</li>
		<li>Divisible: Bitcoin can be easily subdivided.</li>
		<li>Fungible: All bitcoin are interchangeable. One bitcoin is no better in anyway from another bitcoin.</li>
	</ul>
	Combining the digital attributes of Bitcoin with it’s scarcity and lack of trusted third parties, the motley crew of individuals that study Bitcoin tend to refer to it as digital gold, a store of value, or a hard money. 
	Like gold, which has a limited supply and cannot be easily replicated, Bitcoin's scarcity adds to its value proposition as a store of value. 
	Some people view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a way to preserve their wealth over the long term. 
	Fiat currencies can be subject to devaluation due to factors such as inflation, economic instability, or government policies. 
	Advocates believe Bitcoin's attributes help protect against devaluation caused by excessive money printing or inflationary measures. 
	Its scarcity creates an environment where the value of each bitcoin is determined by a fixed supply and dynamic demand rather than being subject to arbitrary changes in supply by central authorities. 
</p>
<p>
	However, it's important to recognize that the value of Bitcoin can be volatile, and <a href="index.html#liability">investing</a> in it carries risks, just like any other investment.
</p>
<h4 id="bitcoin101story">Fascinating Story of Bitcoin</h3>
<p>
	Bitcoin’s story began in 2008 and the story continues to unfold. 
	Some key historical events in the life of Bitcoin are:
	<ul>
		<li>October 31, 2008: Bitcoin White Paper  Released</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, published the Bitcoin whitepaper titled "<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/">Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</a>." This document outlined the core concepts and principles of bitcoin.</li>
			<li>Two months before the first block was mined, the idea of Bitcoin was made public. There were no insiders with an early advantage and the idea could have been put into action before Satoshi did.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>January 3, 2009: Genesis Block Mined</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the Genesis Block, was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. This marked the official launch of the Bitcoin network.</li>
			<li>Embedded in the first block is a headline from the British newspaper The Times: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."</li>
			<li>Not a single bitcoin was issued in advance. Not a single person including Satoshi received bitcoin for free. You can verify this if you wish.</li>
			<li>You can also verify that the first coins likely mined by Satoshi have never moved addresses and are thought to be gone forever.</li>
			<li>Satoshi clearly made a conscious effort for the inception of Bitcoin to be as fair as possible for everyone.</li>
			<li>Hal Finney was the first participant in the Bitcoin network after Satoshi. Check out his initial thoughts <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/bitcoin-list/threads/4/">here</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>May 22, 2010: First Real-World Bitcoin Transactions</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Laszlo Hanyecz famously made the first real-world transaction using Bitcoin, purchasing two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. This transaction is often referred to as "Bitcoin Pizza Day."</li>
			<li>Bitcoin went over a year without a market price. Bitcoin organically bootstrapped itself a value.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>February 2011: Bitcoin Reaches Parity with the US Dollar</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The price of bitcoin rose to and briefly surpassed the value of 1 USD per BTC.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>April 2011: Final Correspondence</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Until April 2011, Nakamoto had email conversations with early Bitcoin developers and contributors. These communications provided insights into the development process, technical discussions, and clarifications related to the Bitcoin protocol. All his correspondences have been archived and can be read <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/threads/">here</a>.</li>
			<li>In April 2011, Nakamoto sent an email expressing concerns about his public profile and stating that he had "moved on to other things." This email signalled Nakamoto's intention to step away from Bitcoin development and the public eye. Nakamoto disappeared from public view. Despite numerous attempts to uncover Nakamoto's true identity, it remains unknown to this day, and their involvement in the project has remained dormant.</li>
			<li>These communications provide valuable insights into Nakamoto's early interactions, the collaborative nature of Bitcoin's development, and the thought process behind its design. The mystery surrounding Nakamoto's identity has contributed to the fascination and intrigue surrounding the origins of Bitcoin.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>March 2013: Finanical Crisis in Cyprus Boosts Bitcoin Popularity</li>
		<ul>
			<li>During a banking crisis in Cyprus, where depositors' funds were frozen, there was a significant increase in interest and demand for Bitcoin as an alternative store of value.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>December 2013: China Bans Financial Institutions from Bitcoin Transactions</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The People's Bank of China issued a statement prohibiting financial institutions from conducting Bitcoin-related transactions, causing a temporary price decline.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>December 2017: Introduction of Bitcoin Futures Contracts</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Major US exchanges, including CME Group and CBOW, launched Bitcoin Futures contracts, allowing institutional investors to speculate on the price.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>March 2020: Covid-19</li>
		<ul>
			<li>During the first few years of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and central banks worldwide implemented various monetary policies to address the economic impact of the crisis.</li>
			<li>The substantial monetary stimulus and increased government spending raised concerns among some observers regarding the potential consequences, including inflationary pressures, devaluation of currencies, and long-term fiscal sustainability.</li>
			<li>This caused significant increase in interest and demand for Bitcoin as an alternative store of value.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>March 2021: Bitcoin Adoption by El Salvador</li>
		<ul>
			<li>El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, passing a law to recognize it alongside the U.S. dollar as an official currency.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>May 2021: China Intensifies Crackdown on Bitcoin Mining and Trading</li>
		<ul>
			<li>China's government tightened its restrictions on Bitcoin mining operations and trading, citing concerns about financial stability and environmental impact. This led to a significant decline in Bitcoin's hash rate.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>February 2022: Canadian Freedom Convoy</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The Canadian Freedom Convoy was a peaceful protest that involved a convoy of trucks, and other vehicles travelling across Canada to Ottawa, the capital city, to express concerns related to various Covid-19 issues.</li>
			<li>During and after this protest, participants were cut off from their bank accounts.</li>
			<li>Bitcoin's censorship-resistant properties and the ability to bypass traditional financial intermediaries made it an attractive option for those involved.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>May 2023: US Presidential Election</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Several US Presidential Candidates from both the <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1661520223357534209">right</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/robert-kennedy-jr-debuts-campaign-at-bitcoin-2023">left</a> have expressed positive views towards bitcoin.</li>
			<li>The discussions are timely, with the next bitcoin halving projected for early 2024.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The story of Bitcoin is captivating and ever-evolving, with new chapters being written. 
	From humble origins as a topic discussed among tinkerers in emails to becoming a subject of conversation with US Presidential Candidates, it is evident that the stage for Bitcoin's story is expanding, leaving the possibility that one day it may take center stage in the spotlight. 
</p>
<h4 id="bitcoin101conculsion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>
	In its early days, Bitcoin garnered the attention of a diverse mix of technologists, tinkerers, libertarians, Austrian economists, and sound money advocates. 
	However, as the distinctive attributes of Bitcoin become more widely recognized, it is increasingly captivating the interest of the general public.
	<br>
	<br>
	Interest in understanding Bitcoin may not be for you, and that is perfectly fine. 
	Another appealing aspect of Bitcoin is its voluntary nature. 
	The decision to delve deeper and learn more is entirely up to you.
