		<p>
            		Whether you like it or not, the genie is out of the bottle. 
            		Bitcoin has bootstrapped itself value, creating a motive for mining, then giving itself more value, and ultimately creating a self-perpetuating loop that sustains itself by our self-interest.
            		And there is no CEO to call and turn it off and without a central authority to shut this thing down, it is difficult to image how it stops. 
		</p>
		<p>
		        Proof-of-work (PoW) serves as the mechanism through which a group of self-interested individuals, each with no more power than another, attain consensus. 
			PoW is not necessary in a fairly tail world where everyone can be trusted to act honestly. 
		        However, given the imperfect world we live in, and with something as important as our money, PoW with the difficulty adjustment is crucial for the proper functioning of the Bitcoin network. 
		        You do not have to agree with it, but at the time of writing this there is roughly 350 exahash per second competing on the Bitcoin network and this has been increasing exponentially since its inception. 
		        This is an enormous amount of computational effort.
		</p>
		<p>
            		Considering the energy-intensive nature of bitcoin mining, what implications could this hold for energy consumption, particularly in relation to our energy grids? 
		</p>
		<p>
			In this article we will look at a few ways Bitcoin could change our energy industries:
