		<p>
      <a href=“https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr”>Nostr</a> is an acronym that stands for <i>Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays</i>. 
      Like Bitcoin, it is a censorship-resistant communication protocol and this communication protocol removes the need for a single trusted third party. 
		</p>
    <p>
      Participants on the nostr network, use public/private key pairs and a client to interact with the network. 
      Clients connect to one or more relays, which pass messages to other participants. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A participant has a private key and an associated public key. 
      A client is software with an understanding of the nostr protocol which is run on anything with an internet connection and can be a web browser, phone application, command terminal, etc. 
      Participants can create an event, sign the event using their private key, then push the signed event to any relays they are connected to. 
      Relays are servers that accept the signed event and forward it to other participants that are also connected to it. 
      Participants can connect to relays run by others or they can easily run their own relay. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nostr is unique due to its censorship resistance and its simplicity. 
      In today’s world, online censorship is real even in first world, free countries. 
      While nostr may remain obscure and/or niche for some time, it will always be available for those that need it. 
      Nostr’s simplicity, reduces the constraints on developers, allowing greater possibilities. 
      An example of nostr’s flexibility and unconstrained development from  simplicity, is zaps. 
      Nostr can easily facilitate bitcoin lightning payments which have been termed zaps. 
      It is very easy for a participant on nostr to add a lightning address and receive compensation for their activity and contributions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, nostr is largely used for forms of social media although, thanks to its simplicity this communication protocol can be used for much more. 
      It will be very interesting to see what is built with nostr over the next decade.
